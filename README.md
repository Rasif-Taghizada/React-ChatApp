You need to create ***Chat application*** using React.js

1. Create a sidebar where all chats will be displayed
2. At the top of the sidebar there should be a button ***"add chat"***, on clicked, a modal-window will open where you will have to specify the name of the chat.

The jsx of modal-window component must be located not inside of ***root*** div, but inside of ***modal*** div, which you need create.

3. When you click on one of the chats, a chat should open on the left side of the screen. At the top of the chat, the name of the chat should be displayed, and at the very bottom there should be an input where you can write any message.

### Note ðŸ““

1. You need to make sure that when you click on one of the chats, the input field, which located at the bottom of chat, must be automatically focused.  
2. The state must not update on every keystroke of the input. Make sure you only update the state when you send a message.
